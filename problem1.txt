For echo command, I simply used

$echo GoHuskies
GoHuskies

For cat command, I created a file called GoHuskies and put a string "GoHuskies" in it, then called cat on it:

$echo GoHuskies > GoHuskies
$cat GoHuskies
GoHuskies

For ls command, I simply called ls on the file GoHuskies:

$ls GoHuskies
GoHuskies

For grep command, I simply made it search for "GoHuskies" inside the GoHuskies file.

$grep -h GoHuskies GoHuskies

For !!, due to the nature of the commmand to print out the previous command first before printing the output,
I first need to create an alias for the GoHuskies word, and made it do nothing.
Then called GoHuskies, then !!

$alias GoHuskies=''
$GoHuskies
$!!
GoHuskies
